# Web Design Resource List
_by Miro Leon Bucher_

This is a list of resources I've used to learn and teach Web Design. Helpful suggestions came from our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pxv5fzmShE), which you are invited to join and contribute to this list that way. You can find more helpful Web Design tutorials and more on my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@miroxleon) if you are interested.
